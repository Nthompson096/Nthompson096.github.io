<h1>Quick research and possible reference guide if I'm lazy (Taken from my MCSA book)</h1>

<p>My tidbit on setting a DNS address for a server in windows server;
There are two ways of configuring an Ethernet Device for DNS; <code>sconfig</code> (server config) or
<br>
<br>
<code>Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias Interface -ServerAddresses IP</code>
<br>
<br>
<b>Note that sconfig is probably better and more interactive; I'd recommend using it if you can.</b>
<br>
You can set a primary and secondary dns address for a server or to direct the dns address to a server.
the commands for the above are pretty self explanatory and as usual would be wise to use admin accounts.
<br>It's a smart idea to configure a STATIC ip address instead of DHCP as that could cause issues with your server
</p>
<h1>Active Directory Domain Services</h1>
<p>Active Directory Domain Services is a server role inside windows server that enables Active Directory and comes with <br>
DNS-Server installed if it isn't already as that's mandatory, to install Windows Active Directory
<br>in a PowerShell commandline environment do the following below</p>
<p>To set a Active Directory Domain Services use <br>
<br>
<code>Install-AD-Domain-Services</code>
<br>
<br>
here's some really basic info on the following.
<br>
<br>
<ul><li><code>Install-ADDSForest</code> adds a new forest</li>
<li><code>Install-ADDSDomainController</code> adds a DC to an existing domain</li>
<li><code>Install-ADDSDomain</code> Adds a new domain to an existing forest, you have to be specific about the parent domain, and domain type and the new domain.</li></ul>

The input of the first two commands would be the same as in
<br>
<br>
<code>Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "example.local"</code>
<br>
<code>Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName "example.local"</code>
<br>
<b><br>The following is different
<br>
Also Don't forget about the domain names.</b>
<br>
<br>
<code>Install-ADDSDomain -NewDomainName "example" -ParentDomainName "example.edu"
-DomainType ChildDomain | ParentDomain</code>
<br>
<br>
if you want help with a command in PowerShell you'd use
<br>
<br>
<code>get-help -some-command -detailed</code>

<p>What I did for my own DC is the following:
<br>
<br>
<code>Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "SANET.local" -DomainNetbiosName "SANET"</code>
<br>
<br>
What I should have done was this:
<br>
<br>
<code>
Install-ADDSForest
<br>-CreateDnsDelegation:$false
<br>-DatabasePath "C:\Windows\NTDS"
<br># DomainMode Is basically which funtional level of the first domain when creating a new forest
<br># Stuff like WinThreshold is basically the running windows server edition
<br>-DomainMode "WinThreshold"
<br># The FQDN of the domain
<br>-DomainName "SAserver.local"
<br># Netbios name for older systems
<br>-DomainNetbiosName "SASERVER"
<br># Forestmode is basically like doaminmode; except it's for the fucntional level of the new forest.
<br>-DomainMode "WinThreshold"
<br># To install a DNS Server
<br>-InstallDns:$true
<br># Where you keep logging for DC
<br>-LogPath "C:\Windows\NTDS"
<br># Keeps all Active Directory files
<br>-SysvolPath "C:\Windows\Sysvol"
<br>-NoRebootOnCompletion:$true
<br>-Force:$true
</code>
<br>
<br>
This following code can be simply used inside a servercore from a PS1 script; the reason why I've branched it out it to make it humanly readable.
</p>

<p>For a server install route you'd usually go to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sever manager</li>
  <li>Add Roles/Features</li>
  <li>Role Based</li>
  <li>Select the server you'd want to install</li>
  <li>Promote the server to a DC, add a new forest with a ".local" or what have you</li>
  <li>For Security be sure to input a password such as "Password01"</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Keep hitting the defaults until you enter review, this should output a XML file
<br>Which can be saved as .PS1 PowerShell script for automation; you can customize these.
<br>The script above is basically what I made with a virtual server as stated earlier.<br></p>
