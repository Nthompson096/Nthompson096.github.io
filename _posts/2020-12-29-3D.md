I will be using my post to discuss 3D modeling; though I'm not quite sure where or how I'd want to lay out this site
Still would be nice to show what I can do with blender; maybe even do some levels for videogames (If i ever feel like it).
Using portainer and a spare computer to manage site, so i'm learning along the way. Trying out automerge but I doubt that'll change anything; better make
this a different post.
