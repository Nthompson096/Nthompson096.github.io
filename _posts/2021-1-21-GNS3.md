Decided to ditch packet tracer for my labs for now; going for GNS3 which deals with emulation instead of simulation unlike packet tracer; though to be fair I do miss some features that came with switching and switchport security and how you'd be abe to assign a hostname yourself unlike gns3 which does it all for you; there's probably a way around that though.

I could use a little bit of both maybe, only time will tell.
