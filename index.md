<h1>Nicholas Thompson:</h1>
<p>born and raised in Pennsylvania, currently a student and soon to be graduate of<br>
ErieIT in Erie for his current Network Database Program, has a Testout PC pro Certification and finished his associate's in specialized technology for graphics now web.</p>
<p>I have been involved in Erie IT since 2015 and was a part time student for graphic design, my main interest was/is 3D modeling, after my graduation I've decided to take on the task of Network Database Professional
I was mainly interested in troubleshooting computers and devices, and have a growing interest in Active Directory since my admission there.</p>
<p>Before hand my experience with computers goes back to the beginning of highschool; when I was just starting I decided to make a lame batch file and
create a silly little batch script which made people completely loose their minds;
the school decided to hire me as a student IT but under supervision I'd assume (can't blame them, don't want little nick running amock in AD).
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in 3D technologies also interested in IT, you can see more in the <b>about me</b> section.

This is webpage; this is where I can spill what I'm currently doing for now on the net if I'm inclined.
For <b>3D stuff</b> it's obvious that's in the <b>3D page in the navbar</b>, and I will be using an image gallery for my works and a few videos.<br>
My general posts or blogs will be in the posts section of this site; though I'm still trying to plan this all out.<br>
Who knows maybe it'll take <b>15 years</b>â€¦ <b><i>sike</i></b>
