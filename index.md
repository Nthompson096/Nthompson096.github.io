# Nicholas Thompson:<br>
born and raised in Pennsylvania, currently a student and soon to be graduate of
ErieIT in Erie for his current Network Database Program, has a Testout PC pro Certification and finished his associate's in specialized technology for graphics now web. <br> I'm interested in 3D technologies but also interested in IT, you can see more in the **about me** section.<br>
This is/my webpage; this is where I can spill what I'm currently doing for now on the net if I'm inclined.
Sometimes I like to post total nonsense, but that would be in another page, **I'm still working on this website.**
For 3D stuff it's obvious that's in the 3D page in the navbar, will be using an image gallery.<br>
My general posts or blogs will be in the posts section of this site; though I'm still trying to plan this all out.<br>
Who knows maybe it'll take **15 years**â€¦ *sike!*
